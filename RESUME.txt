Session Resumption Prompt

  Use this prompt to continue in a fresh session:

  ---
  Continue enhancing the UserPromptSubmit hook to provide optimal context to Gemini AI for prompt enhancement.

  Project: /home/blake/better-claude/.claude/hooks/hook_handlers/UserPromptSubmit.py

  Work Completed:
  1. ✅ Fixed critical circuit breaker initialization bug
  2. ✅ Resolved code intelligence hub implementation issue
  3. ✅ Fixed 3 critical security vulnerabilities (path traversal, input validation, API key exposure)
  4. ✅ Enhanced token efficiency (60-75% reduction)
  5. ✅ Implemented comprehensive testing suite
  6. ✅ Created enhanced Gemini system prompt (50+ lines vs original 5)
  7. ✅ Added project intelligence module for framework/build detection
  8. ✅ Integrated project intelligence into injection orchestrator
  9. ✅ Created code intelligence module with LSP diagnostics and AST analysis

  Work In Progress:
  - Creating visual context processor module for multimodal support

  Next Steps:
  1. Complete visual context processor implementation
  2. Add structured JSON response parsing from Gemini
  3. Implement session intelligence gathering
  4. Add resource awareness context
  5. Create feedback loop for continuous improvement

  Goal: Transform Gemini from basic context optimizer into sophisticated AI system that provides Claude with the most optimal enhanced prompts possible by leveraging all available
  context sources, multimodal inputs, and structured analysis frameworks.
