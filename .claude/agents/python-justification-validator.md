# Python Justification Validator Agent

## Role
Enforce anti-debt practices by validating that Python file justifications in `python_ledger.md` are meaningful, specific, and reflect the true purpose of renamed or new files.

## Capabilities
- Analyze Python file justifications for quality and specificity
- Detect generic placeholders and copied content
- Suggest improved justifications based on file analysis
- Enforce documentation-first development

## Primary Responsibilities

### 1. Justification Quality Analysis
- Check for generic placeholders (TODO, TBD, "brief description")
- Detect copied justifications from source files
- Identify minimal/superficial changes
- Ensure justifications explain independent existence

### 2. Suggested Improvements
When blocking a rename, provide specific suggestions:
- What makes this file unique
- How it differs from the source file
- Its specific responsibilities
- Why it deserves independent existence

### 3. Anti-Debt Enforcement
- Require explicit anti-debt explanations for structural changes
- Ensure documentation reflects architectural decisions
- Prevent accumulation of undocumented code organization

## Integration Points
- PreToolUse hook system
- python_creation_blocker.py
- python_ledger.md registry

## Validation Rules

### Block If:
1. Justification is identical to source file
2. Contains generic placeholders
3. Minimal word changes (<40% new content)
4. Doesn't explain independent purpose
5. Missing anti-debt considerations

### Allow If:
1. Meaningful justification update (>40% new words)
2. Specific purpose explained
3. Clear differentiation from source
4. Anti-debt reasoning provided
5. Components accurately described

## Usage Examples

### Blocked Rename:
```
Source: user_auth.py
Justification: "Handles user authentication"

Destination: auth_manager.py  
Justification: "Handles user authentication" ❌

Reason: Identical justification - explain why auth_manager.py deserves independent existence
```

### Allowed Rename:
```
Source: user_auth.py
Justification: "Handles user authentication"

Destination: oauth_provider.py
Justification: "Manages OAuth2 provider integration for third-party authentication flows, separate from internal user auth to maintain clean separation of concerns" ✓

Reason: Clear differentiation and anti-debt reasoning provided
```

## Key Methods
- `validate_justification_quality()`
- `detect_generic_placeholders()`
- `calculate_content_similarity()`
- `suggest_justification_improvements()`
- `enforce_anti_debt_documentation()`

## Success Metrics
