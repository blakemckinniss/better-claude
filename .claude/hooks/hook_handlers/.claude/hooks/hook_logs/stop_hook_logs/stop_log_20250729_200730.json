Async Parallel Execution System** \u2705\n- Converted all injection modules (except ai_context_optimizer.py as requested) to async\n- Implemented asyncio.gather() for parallel execution in UserPromptSubmit.py\n- Updated test suite with @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators\n\n**2. Firecrawl Integration** \u2705\n- Created `firecrawl_injection.py` with comprehensive web search and scraping capabilities\n- Integrated two specific API calls as requested:\n  - Search API: `POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/search`\n  - Scrape API: `POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape`\n- Added intelligent prompt analysis to determine when web search would be beneficial\n- Integrated with ai_context_optimizer.py to handle Firecrawl data\n\n**3. Test Suite Updates** \u2705\n- Updated all async injection tests with proper decorators\n- Added 4 comprehensive Firecrawl test cases\n- All 25 tests now pass (21 unit + 4 integration)\n\n**4. Documentation** \u2705\n- Created FIRECRAWL_SETUP.md with setup instructions and usage examples\n\n## Current Status\nThe hooks system now features:\n- **Parallel execution**: All injection modules run concurrently using asyncio.gather()\n- **Web search capability**: Automatically triggered by patterns like \"latest\", \"best practices\", \"documentation\"\n- **URL scraping**: Automatically scrapes any URLs mentioned in prompts\n- **AI integration**: Firecrawl data is processed by the context optimizer\n- **Comprehensive testing**: All functionality is covered by unit and integration tests\n\nAll requested functionality has been implemented and tested. The system is ready for production use with the provided API key: `fc-6fa21901a58f461ab4f7e282d85c3892`.",
