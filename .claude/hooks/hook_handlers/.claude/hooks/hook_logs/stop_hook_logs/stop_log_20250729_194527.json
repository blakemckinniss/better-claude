    "content": "Perfect! The AI context optimizer is now fully working and tested. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n## \u2705 Issues Fixed & Tests Updated\n\n1. **Fixed async event loop conflict** - Updated `optimize_injection_sync()` to handle both test and production environments\n2. **Enhanced mock tests** - Better assertions checking for specific content and OpenRouter integration markers  \n3. **Added real API test** - `test_real_api_integration()` validates actual OpenRouter API calls (8.26s execution time shows real API interaction)\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Test Results\n\n- **Mock tests pass** - Verifies proper API response handling and fallback behavior\n- **Real API test passes** - Confirms the optimizer works with actual OpenRouter calls\n- **Event loop compatibility** - Fixed for both pytest async environment and production sync calls\n\nThe AI context optimizer is now properly integrated and working as designed through the UserPromptSubmit hook.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Monitor production usage** - Check `.claude/hooks/hook_logs/` for optimization performance metrics in real usage\n2. **Tune optimization parameters** - Adjust temperature/models in `ai_context_optimizer.py` based on context quality feedback  \n3. **Extend to other hooks** - Consider adding AI optimization to `PostToolUse` for adaptive context learning",
