    "content": "Perfect! The improvements are working correctly. Here's what was fixed:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n1. **Fixed AI Context Optimizer Prompt**:\n   - Changed from a generic template-based prompt to a more direct instruction\n   - Now asks the AI to analyze the specific user prompt and context\n   - Creates a role tailored to the actual task instead of a generic \"Prompt Optimization Expert\"\n   - Uses clearer section headers that focus on the current context and task\n\n2. **Improved Fallback Optimization**:\n   - Enhanced the rule-based fallback with a more structured format\n   - Better detection of user intent (debug, implement, analyze, etc.)\n   - Extracts and highlights git information and critical issues\n   - Provides a more useful role-based format even without AI\n\n3. **Added Git ls-files Context**:\n   - Updated `git_injection.py` to include file summary information\n   - Now shows total tracked files, top file types, top directories\n   - Includes recently modified files from the last 24 hours\n   - Uses parallel execution for better performance\n\nThe AI context optimizer should now:\n- Generate role-based prompts specific to the user's actual request\n- Include relevant context data in the role definition\n- Avoid generic \"AI Prompt Optimization Expert\" responses\n- Provide more actionable and focused assistance",
