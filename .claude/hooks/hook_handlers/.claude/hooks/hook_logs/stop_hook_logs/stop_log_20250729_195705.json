    "content": "The test suite has been successfully updated to handle all async injection modules. I've completed the entire async conversion project:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n1. **Async Conversion**: Converted all I/O-heavy injection modules to async:\n   - `git_injection.py` - Git commands now use `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`\n   - `test_status_injection.py` - Made main function async\n   - `context_history_injection.py` - Made main function async\n\n2. **Parallel Execution**: Implemented `asyncio.gather()` in `UserPromptSubmit.py` to run 5 injection modules in parallel, improving performance from sequential to concurrent execution.\n\n3. **Test Updates**: Updated all relevant tests in `hook_test.py`:\n   - Added `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators\n   - Updated mocking for async functions\n   - Fixed subprocess patching for new async implementation\n   - All tests now pass (21 total: 17 unit, 4 integration)\n\n4. **Event Loop Handling**: Implemented ThreadPoolExecutor pattern to handle nested event loops in both test and production environments.\n\nThe async parallel execution system is now fully operational with comprehensive test coverage. Performance testing showed successful parallel execution with approximately 9.4 seconds total time including AI optimization.",
