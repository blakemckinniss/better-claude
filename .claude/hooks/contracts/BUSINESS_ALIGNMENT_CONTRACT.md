# Business Alignment Contract

## Purpose
This contract ensures all technical implementations, agent operations, and system changes align with business requirements, deliver measurable value, and maintain strategic coherence. It establishes frameworks for Business Requirements Document (BRD) validation, Product Requirements Document (PRD) adherence, and continuous business value measurement.

## Core Principles

### 1. Business Value Framework

#### 1.1 Value Measurement Standards
- All features MUST have quantifiable business metrics defined upfront
- ROI calculations MUST be documented and validated quarterly
- Business impact MUST be measurable within defined timeframes
- Value realization MUST be tracked and reported continuously
- Failed initiatives MUST trigger lessons learned documentation

#### 1.2 Business Metrics Schema
```json
{
  "business_metrics": {
    "primary_kpis": [
      {
        "metric_name": "string",
        "baseline_value": "number",
        "target_value": "number", 
        "measurement_period": "days",
        "business_impact": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
      }
    ],
    "secondary_metrics": [],
    "success_criteria": {
      "minimum_viable_success": "string",
      "optimal_success": "string",
      "measurement_methodology": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Stakeholder Value Alignment

    frequency: "continuous"
```

#### 2.3 Requirements Traceability Matrix
- Every code change MUST link to specific BRD/PRD requirement
