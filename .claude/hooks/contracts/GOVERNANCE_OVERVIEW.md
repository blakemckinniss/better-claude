# Better-Claude Governance Framework Overview

## Executive Summary

The Better-Claude governance framework consists of 13 interconnected contracts that establish comprehensive standards for AI-assisted development operations. This framework ensures security, quality, performance, and business alignment across all system components through a hierarchical contract structure with automated enforcement and continuous monitoring.

### Framework Philosophy
- **Token Conservation**: Every operation optimized for 200k token limits with subagent delegation
- **Security-First**: All operations governed by security requirements with zero-trust architecture
- **Business Alignment**: Technical decisions validated against business value and requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation at every level
- **Performance Excellence**: Sub-second response times with graceful degradation
