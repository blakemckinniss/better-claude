# Performance Monitoring Contract

## Purpose
This contract establishes performance standards and monitoring requirements for the better-claude system, ensuring optimal resource utilization, response times, and system stability. This contract is HIGH priority for maintaining user experience quality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Performance Thresholds

#### 1.1 Hook Execution Limits
```json
{
  "hook_timeouts": {
    "PreToolUse": "2000ms",
    "PostToolUse": "5000ms", 
    "UserPromptSubmit": "10000ms",
    "Notification": "1000ms",
    "Stop": "500ms",
    "SubagentStop": "500ms"
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Memory Usage Boundaries
- **Hook execution**: 50MB per hook maximum
- **Context storage**: 200MB rolling window
- **Cache size**: 100MB for frequently accessed data
- **Emergency threshold**: 1GB total system memory

#### 1.3 Response Time SLAs
- **Interactive commands**: <500ms p95
- **Code analysis**: <2s p95
- **File operations**: <1s p95
- **Complex operations**: <10s p95

### 2. Context Size Management

#### 2.1 Context Window Optimization
- Maximum context per operation: 150k tokens
- Context compression threshold: 100k tokens
- Automatic pruning: Remove oldest non-critical data
- Priority retention: Error logs, recent commands, active files

#### 2.2 Token Conservation Strategy
```
- Compress repeated patterns
- Summarize verbose outputs
- Cache frequently accessed content  
- Use delta compression for file changes
```
