# Contract Integration Framework

## Purpose
This meta-governance contract establishes the overarching framework for integrating, managing, and resolving conflicts between all governance contracts within the Claude Code ecosystem. It defines contract hierarchy, conflict resolution mechanisms, and unified enforcement procedures to ensure coherent governance across all operational domains.

## Core Principles

### 1. Contract Hierarchy and Precedence

#### 1.1 Contract Precedence Order
```yaml
contract_hierarchy:
  tier_1_foundational:
    - "SECURITY_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT"
    - "BUSINESS_ALIGNMENT_CONTRACT"
    precedence: "highest"
    override_authority: "none"
  tier_2_operational:
    - "QUALITY_ASSURANCE_CONTRACT"
    - "AGENT_COORDINATION_CONTRACT"
    precedence: "high"
    override_authority: "tier_1_only"
  tier_3_implementation:
    - "HOOK_CONTRACT"
    - "PROMPT_CONTRACT"
    - "ZEN_CONTRACT"
    precedence: "standard"
    override_authority: "tier_1_and_2"
  tier_4_specialized:
    - "domain_specific_contracts"
    precedence: "lowest"
    override_authority: "all_higher_tiers"
```

#### 1.2 Contract Interaction Principles
- Higher-tier contracts MUST take precedence in conflicts
- Security requirements MUST never be compromised for other objectives
- Business alignment MUST be maintained across all technical decisions
- Quality standards MUST be preserved in all implementations
- Contract violations MUST trigger automatic escalation procedures

#### 1.3 Cross-Contract Dependencies
- Contract requirements MUST be consistent and non-contradictory
- Shared concepts MUST have unified definitions across contracts
- Integration points MUST be explicitly documented and validated
- Contract updates MUST assess impact on dependent contracts

### 2. Conflict Resolution Framework

#### 2.1 Conflict Detection Mechanisms
```python
def detect_contract_conflicts():
    return {
        "static_analysis": {
            "requirement_contradiction": "automated_scanning",
            "policy_inconsistency": "rule_engine_validation",
            "constraint_conflicts": "logical_inference"
        },
        "runtime_detection": {
            "competing_requirements": "real_time_monitoring",
            "resource_conflicts": "allocation_tracking",
            "priority_disputes": "decision_tree_analysis"
        },
        "compliance_monitoring": {
            "multi_contract_violations": "cross_reference_checking",
            "escalation_triggers": "threshold_monitoring",
            "resolution_tracking": "audit_trail_analysis"
        }
    }
```

#### 2.2 Conflict Resolution Process
1. **Automatic Resolution**: System attempts resolution using precedence rules
2. **Escalation Trigger**: Unresolvable conflicts escalate to governance board
3. **Stakeholder Consultation**: Affected parties provide input and constraints
4. **Resolution Decision**: Governance board makes binding resolution
5. **Implementation**: Resolution is implemented with full audit trail
6. **Monitoring**: Resolution effectiveness is monitored and validated

#### 2.3 Conflict Resolution Matrix
```yaml
conflict_types:
  security_vs_performance:
    resolution_approach: "security_precedence"
    mitigation: "performance_optimization_within_security_bounds"
  business_vs_quality:
    resolution_approach: "stakeholder_negotiation"
    mitigation: "minimum_quality_threshold_enforcement"
  coordination_vs_autonomy:
    resolution_approach: "balance_with_clear_boundaries"
    mitigation: "context_specific_delegation_rules"
```

### 3. Unified Governance Framework

#### 3.1 Governance Board Structure
- **Security Representative**: Ensures security compliance across all decisions
- **Business Representative**: Validates business value and alignment
- **Quality Representative**: Maintains quality standards and metrics
- **Technical Representative**: Assesses technical feasibility and impact
- **Compliance Representative**: Ensures regulatory and policy adherence

#### 3.2 Decision-Making Authority Matrix
```json
{
  "decision_authority": {
    "routine_operations": "automated_systems",
    "policy_interpretations": "domain_experts", 
    "cross_contract_conflicts": "governance_board",
    "emergency_exceptions": "incident_commander",
    "strategic_changes": "executive_committee"
  },
  "appeal_process": {
    "first_level": "domain_expert_review",
    "second_level": "governance_board_review",
    "final_level": "executive_committee_decision"
  }
