# API Integration Contract

## Purpose
This contract establishes governance for external API integrations within the better-claude project, ensuring reliable, secure, and efficient communication with third-party services including OpenRouter, OpenAI, and Anthropic APIs. This contract is CRITICAL priority for system stability.

## Core Principles

### 1. API Service Management

#### 1.1 Service Provider Hierarchy
- **Primary**: OpenRouter (multi-model gateway)
- **Secondary**: Direct provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Fallback**: Local model endpoints when available
- **Emergency**: Cached responses or degraded functionality

#### 1.2 Authentication Standards
```json
{
  "api_keys": {
    "rotation_interval": "30d",
    "storage": "environment_variables",
    "validation": "startup_health_check",
    "fallback_keys": "provider_specific"
  }
}
```

### 2. Rate Limiting and Quotas

#### 2.1 Request Management
- **Tier 1 (Critical)**: 100 req/min - System operations
- **Tier 2 (Standard)**: 60 req/min - User interactions
- **Tier 3 (Background)**: 20 req/min - Non-essential tasks
- **Emergency Brake**: 10 req/min when quotas exceeded

#### 2.2 Quota Distribution
- Reserve 20% capacity for critical operations
- Implement exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
- Circuit breaker: Open after 5 consecutive failures
- Health check interval: 30 seconds when degraded

### 3. Timeout and Retry Strategies

#### 3.1 Timeout Hierarchy
```
- Connection timeout: 5s
- Read timeout: 30s (standard), 120s (complex operations)
- Total request timeout: 180s maximum
- Health check timeout: 3s
```

#### 3.2 Retry Logic
- **Immediate retry**: Network errors (max 2 attempts)
- **Delayed retry**: Rate limits (respect retry-after header)
- **Exponential backoff**: Server errors (max 3 attempts)
- **No retry**: Authentication errors, malformed requests

### 4. Error Propagation Standards

#### 4.1 Error Classification
- **Fatal**: Authentication failures, quota exhaustion
- **Transient**: Network timeouts, temporary server errors
- **Degraded**: Partial functionality, fallback triggered
- **Warning**: Rate limit approaching, slow responses

#### 4.2 Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "api_error|network_error|auth_error|quota_error",
    "provider": "openrouter|openai|anthropic|local",
    "message": "human_readable_description",
    "code": "provider_specific_error_code",
    "retry_after": "seconds_to_wait",
    "fallback_available": true|false
  }
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. API Client Architecture
- Implement unified API client interface
- Provider-specific adapters for each service
- Connection pooling and keep-alive optimization  
- Request/response logging with sensitive data masking

### 2. Monitoring Integration
- Track API response times and success rates
- Monitor quota usage and remaining capacity
- Alert on error rate thresholds (>5% in 5min window)
- Dashboard for API health and performance metrics

### 3. Fallback Chain Implementation
- Automatic failover between providers
- Graceful degradation when all APIs unavailable
- Local caching for frequently accessed data
- User notification of degraded service levels

## Validation Criteria

### 1. Reliability Metrics
- **Uptime**: >99.5% API availability
- **Response time**: <2s p95 for standard requests
- **Error rate**: <2% across all providers
- **Fallback success**: >95% when primary unavailable

### 2. Security Requirements
- API keys never logged or exposed in error messages
- TLS 1.3 minimum for all connections
- Request/response validation against schemas
- Audit trail for all API interactions

### 3. Performance Standards
- Concurrent request limit: 50 per provider
- Memory usage: <100MB for API client layer
- CPU overhead: <5% during normal operations
- Network efficiency: Connection reuse >80%

## Enforcement

### 1. Automated Checks
- Pre-deployment API endpoint validation
- Continuous monitoring of SLA compliance
- Automated failover testing every 24 hours
- Security scan of API integration code

### 2. Violation Responses
- **Minor**: Log warning, continue operation
- **Major**: Trigger fallback, alert administrators
- **Critical**: Emergency stop, manual intervention required
- **Security**: Immediate key rotation, audit trigger

### 3. Compliance Reporting
- Daily API health reports
- Weekly performance trend analysis
- Monthly security audit summary
- Quarterly SLA compliance review

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. API Outage Response
1. Detect outage via health checks
2. Activate fallback chain immediately
3. Notify users of degraded service
4. Log incident for post-mortem analysis

### 2. Security Incident Response
1. Immediately revoke compromised keys
2. Rotate all related credentials
3. Review audit logs for suspicious activity
4. Implement additional monitoring if needed

### 3. Quota Exhaustion Recovery
1. Implement emergency rate limiting
2. Prioritize critical system operations
3. Queue non-essential requests
4. Negotiate emergency quota increases if available
